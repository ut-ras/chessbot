# Goal: To create a simple bitboard implementation for a chess board, 
# move class to prompt the user for a move, update the bitboard with the move, 
# and track changes between bitboards to test keeping track of individual pieces and to check for move legality 


# RealBoard class is a simple 2D array representation of a chess board with pieces/colors, black pieces are lowercase and white pieces are uppercase. This is what will track the actual state of the game/pieces.
# Bitboard class is a 64 bit integer representation of the chess board, where each bit represents a square on the board. 

#when "square" is used, it refers to a coordinate on the chess board in, where a1 is the bottom left corner, and h8 is the top right corner.
#when "position" is used, it refers to the bitboard position, where 0 is the top left corner, and 63 is the bottom right corner.
